Patches are always welcome!  Please submit your patches via KylinMod Gerrit!
You can do this by using these commands:

    . build/envsetup.sh
    (Go to repo you are patching, make your changes and commit)
    kmgerrit <for(new)/changes(patch set)> <branch/change-id> 

    repo start kitkat .
    (Make your changes and commit)
    repo upload .
Note: "." meaning current directory
For more help on using this tool, use this command: repo help upload

Make your changes and commit with a detailed message, starting with what you are working with (i.e. vision: Update Kernel)
Commit your patches in a single commit. Squash multiple commit using this command: git rebase -i HEAD~<# of commits>

Getting Started
---------------

To get started with Android/KylinMod, you'll need to get
familiar with [Git and Repo](http://source.android.com/source/using-repo.html).

To initialize your local repository using the KylinMod trees, use a command like this:

    repo init -u git://github.com/mikylin/android_manifest.git -b kitkat

Then to sync up:

    repo sync

Please see the Github for building instructions.

Start build
----------
First, go to the root path of your project. We assume that your source is under 
(/kylin):

    cd /mikylin
    
then

    . build/envsetup.sh
    
Next

    lunch
  
Choose your model number that corresponds to the digital input into the command window

Next

    make bacon -j8
  
Finally, the wait for the completion and enjoy your new system


All supported devices are built nightly and periodically as changes are committed to ensure the source trees remain buildable.
